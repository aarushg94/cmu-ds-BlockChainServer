# cmu-ds-BlockChainServer

Stand-alone blockchain program with a remote client that interacts with a blockchain API. Based on the client input the program calls it's helper methods to do various transactions on the blockchain such as viewing the status, adding a new transaction, viewing the blockchain itself, corrupting and repairing the chain after it verifies the identity of the client. After doing the computations, it then sends this fetched data back to the client.
